        <p align="justify"><FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica,arial" SIZE=2>One day he was standing next to some tree and was not actually doing anything that could involve brain activity. <br>
I don't see it that way, he said… more like whispered at her ear. And she sure heard him well and she didn't really mind that he was some kind of someone she didn't really like at all.<br>
Would you like to be plugged in? <br>
Would you like to be connected?  <br>
Yes, I would like to be connected with whoever wants me to do that. <br>
I was out of that world of becoming differently accustomed to what ever was left in a fridge state. <br>
I have taken my time, but it wasn't too long…                               <br>
About as evil as you could be…                                                  <br>
Nothing is organized as you wold imagine that to be in your perfect world of pure misunderstanding of purely unknown culture of things like the way they should be explained in a logical manner of a pure mind.<br>
I couldn't help it. I just could not eat at that time…  All I could do is not healthy thinking of things that supposedly were healthy as cultural perception of things on the abstract matter.                  <br>
<p>
Things are fine… as always. And as always things are getting better and better. <br>
I just need to look for them so to see. And did you see them. No I didn't see them at all. Are any of these out there?<br>
Barely initiated… Barely invited.<br> 
When I feel intrigued it feels like all those frozen pipes are getting worm and they get bent over like that ice cream that is about to be melt down. Melt down to the ground. To the ground of melancholy and utter calm. To the ground of the ground.<br>
To the point when there is nothing below that. <br>
To the point when I am about to pass out.      <br>
To the point when I'm not gut.              <br>
To the point when I'm gonna live.           <br>
To the point when I'm gonna quit you.       <br>
Right now.                                <br>
I said right now.                         <br>
So maybe the problem is you.              <br>
The helicopter was there as soon as we arrived. <br>
Awesome is not beautiful. It is not beautiful at all. So next time that you wouldn't be amazed by all the views that you would be exposed to. <br>
I have got to wait a little before I go in. <br>
