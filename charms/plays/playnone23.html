        <p align="justify"><FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica,arial" SIZE=2>I have always had what my parents dreamt about and what they could never have.<br>
  <p>
All the windows in the car were tear-stained. The warmth of the oven's wind reminded of a dry summer breeze.    <br>
                <p> <p>

	Acitizenation    <br>
                        <p> <p>
Part 1. How it all began.  <br>
             <p>
	I went to "apply for a Citizenship".<br>
	Ida, my helper in this sacred deed, that always seemed/pretended/appeared to be busy, quickly filled out all the necessary forms, while smoking up the place, and squinting her eyes every time I would pause with answering some question. At the last moment, right before a long way towards so much desired Citizenship was about to begin by affixing my signature, she asked: <br>
- Have you ever been arrested?   <br>
- I have, - I answered with out any desire to answer, feeling that my desire <br> 
not to answer transforms into desire to immediately explain myself. <br>
- Really? - Ida was unpleasantly surprised. <br>
There is a plethora of characters (if only it is not a part of every character) that to say at least are easily impressed and ready to rush to a certainty of a conclusion, which naturally will make the object more understandable. <br>
- He appeared to be such a good boy, but as it came out, he is a criminal and a liar, - that was the meaning of the mistrusts' shadows towards me on Ida's immediate existence. <br>
- Oh no, it is not what it sounds like, - thought like this almost surfaced my consciousness, but then said: - Yes, the story was not rather pleasant, but they said that "I will be fine", - I was about to start stuttering and had a suspicion that Ida's concrete certainty on this matter could not be dissolved. But then I thought that she didn't give a shit. <br>
Whatever… The case was closed for a reason of no criminal basement. Well the basement was there. But it was a civil one. But still I was told "not to get in any troubles for the next 6 month." Yes, just give me a couple of seconds and I will get in some other trouble, so some red neck fuck will cuff my arms behind my back because he was told/taught that whatever I just did was illegal and why don't I spend some time in his cheap Caprice with some Christmas toys on a top of it on a way to Brooklyn jail, where some gay-bitchy looking guard will read to chimpanzee-like-hanging-off-the-cells-rails mates of mine what presumption of innocence is. <br>
- Whatever, - said Ida, - were you fingerprinted?  <br>
- Ahh…yes, I was, - I said confused by being uncertain of my subtle hesitation. (Then again, constant thrive for certainty is sometimes one of my sins as well)    <br>
- Than that is it, - said Ida affirmatively while showing off her growing frustration (yet it was a subtle frustration at the time) by poking out the glowing eyes of her cellular phone, - go to the Court (honestly, I hate this whole capitalizing shit) and get the Court Disposition (Pardon Of The Sins of some kind). Then she quickly wrapped up signing, copying, sealing, gave me an envelope with my own photo pictures (I was smiling strangely on them, because wasn't very comfy when posing/smiling at Ida's photo-rifle flowing in tobacco fog), and told me to fax her that Pardon thing.  <br>
	Thoroughly scanned by outdated Court's hardware (I think you can bring a battalion of armed Chechens in pleaded depth of your Gucci coat and this thing would not work: the reason I think so, is that buckle on my belt can be melt down on premises into a very good sniper's rifle (100 grams of good steal!)), I penetrated the lobby that was not about to start moving very smoothly along the coal-like shaft of a very sad Farida's manifestation. Thinking even God didn't know what, I was sent by the previously provoked by asking, skinny officer's response to the room number five hundred eleven. <br>
I didn't wait for the elevator, and breathing heavily while impetuously conquering the ascent of stinking like Clorox commercial staircase, I breathed heavily some more, looking at some relatively fat white bastard which was very politely (and with a smile!) describing something to a black guy with his teeth shoed with gold. As it came out, the guy was trying to find out (there is no way that guy looked like someone that would be able to memorize all/any of his exploits/feats) if he gained any fame within any part of the criminal database. White fatty knocked on his keyboard, then moved his mouse (computer mouse), than drew something on a scrap of paper (which meant that Odyssey is not over yet), than was asked to repeat whatever he just said again which resulted in him knocking on his keyboard again, and then he moved his mouse again (computer mouse), and then he performed some mysterious drawing again but only on a smaller scrap of paper (the only certainty I could find at that time - it was not a parchment), and then with a great deal of relieve (looked like it) looked at me. (Me, me, me, finally!) It was a sign. It was my turn.<br>
(I didn't know how to fulfill the moment while waiting for the Fatty (he was fat) performing all of his silly rituals. Then I decided to kill him! NOT LITERALLY OF COURSE, YOU MORON!!! I just got upset. Yes, I got upset over the very simple fact: Humanity didn't go very far in self-technological advancement. I felt very bitter for not being able to replace that moving, and obviously pretending for competence "something", for some pretty, sexy robot. And then I realized. That's right! I will dedicate my life to science, and maybe with my help, when I'll be 86, I will come back at this precise spot and will see a sexy robot that will be able to give me any type of data and make me orgasmic at the same time… But… I thought right there… If I'll start flirting with this girly in this far future, (unless she was my immediate project) her software will get fucked up (for variety of reasons). Than I though… fuck it. I'll go with a fat white bastard.)  <br>
          <p>
So it was my turn. <br> 
I got something that looked like a first clue in the labyrinths of dangerous paths to the fountains of pardons. <br>

I had to go to RM 811, hell knows where this place is. RM 811. But, despite the whole seriousness of the whole note, upon arrival, I discovered that whoever runs this place was "OUT FOR A LUNCH".  <br>
The place was rather obscure to be used for meditation or philosophical solo debate. I was not sleepy either. I knew I would not be able to kill the time, but at least I was hoping to make it bleed. I should say that right before I squatted (Later my legs felt like the waters of Dnepr entered the vessels of my circulatory systems and clogged it with a caviar of nesting fish) I looked (I did my best to succeed at this) through the soot of public window (That at first glance looked like it was a dramatic cocktail mixed my misery using dust, microbes, tears and nervous breathing of poor victims of a system this window claimed to be a part of): I could not see the ground. And it was only the ninth floor…  <br>
	I was writing squatted. Then I was writing standing up before and after another "wanna be human" (or may be "don't wanna be human": honesty, honesty!) relatively quickly issued me paper something, previously packed in the envelope that she licked all over for a bit longer time that was needed, and only than she handed IT to me!  <br>
	I grabbed all this, and after standing next to the doorjamb while finishing up all this mumbo-jumbo, ran downstairs to the Fatty's amenities. <br>
	I had to see some other bastard that was making his face obvious through the round crack of the window near by. After seeing some black bum arguing with the Obvious for some time about unknown to me issue I silently stick the envelope (that I was given a hint to be dead for opening it) under the glass mass and saw it entering kingdom of the Obvious. Obvious was silent and even got Significant when handed me The Pardon. I thanked Obvious the Significant and hoping that whatever happened to me in the past two hours will inevitably get drawn in my subconsciousness, fled away.   <br>
	 I got this thing faxed to Ida and after calling her few weeks later I told her that I forgot to send her that fax (Subconsciousness was indeed absorbent). She said if I drank something and if yes how much, which meant that mysterious process of Ositizenation began. <br>
