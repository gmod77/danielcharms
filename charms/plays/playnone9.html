        <p align="justify"><FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica,arial" SIZE=2>I walked all around my cubicle. <br>
-	Now the link isn't working...<br>
-	Are you uninstalled?         <br>
-	I crash all the time if I am installed...<br>
                                                    <br><br>

I have to start working "hard"... Working "hard". That's what would bring some understanding to the uncertainty that I am currently in... Work would adjust my thinking to the shape that could be described in "actual" words. I should start pushing myself. I was making myself "uncomfortable" enough to freeze the soul out of my body - and I never used that coolness to evolve. This time I should be able to say something and be "certain" about what I just said. I would have to be able to remember what I have said, otherwise it is nothing but a worm that is just eating me from inside.  <br>
       <p> I should start saying "have to". Why? Because I have to find something. Do I need to? What do I really want from this world? What do I expect from it any way? And why, why should I have all these questions? Life would go and life would come with all the variety that I could never be really interested in. I would just witness. I would just play the role that was assigned to me by the creator (or any name of that source) of all that variety.  <br>
But there is some certainty. Even the certainty of being uncertain is nothing but a degree of certainty... Sounds hideous... And "hideous" is a certainty as well. Any kind of adjective is some kind of certainty. (God, it's harsh to be so certain and specific).  <br>
       <p> Speaking with less (ideally none) adjectives. <br>
The truth is always rigid. The philosophical thinking is always rigid too. Literature is less rigid. That's why it is assumed that "good" literature should always be "esthetically appealing". Esthetics in its turn, is taking away too much power from the truth, by making the beholder to see the beauty of that truth. Therefore, truth has nothing to do with beauty at all. Esthetics has nothing to do with the truth as well. Those are all obstacles that will try to keep you from your way to understand things. And even when you are there, adjectives will harm you again. <br>
       <p> Assuming the actuality of the presence of the truth, is difficult to find a possible satisfying result... Then... It would be more and more hard to "make" yourself crave that scary substance that is called "truth" because the conscious understanding of the fact that you don't actually posses that substance will provoke the unconscious to crave for perfection to compensate this state by spreading the juices of esthetics in the hell of "fault being", that's if it's possible to give this name exactly to it.   <br>
       <p> Having responsibility to act I should not wait any longer...  <br>
