        <p align="justify"><FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica,arial" SIZE=2>Now, allow me to think that I am a hell of a typist or something like that - I can type really fast - I am the bomb and even more of a bomb than you think - I am a fucking typing racket that just wouldn't stop. That would go on and on and would not ever stop to even think of something that could come on you which is fucking insulting anyways - good to have everything together oops and oops again. <br>
I want to explain to everyone that no war is going to happen - everyone will be dying on his or her own. Isn't that cool and heart breaking at the same time of the year? Hell, I am a fucking great typist and because of that you would not ever be the same in terms of speed of thought. Life, you are beautiful! <br>
What did she want was so bad. She called me daddy. She wanted someone to always care and look after her all the time. Wasn't that just awful - yes that was really awful. I can be let's say a security God. <br>
Life became a little problem that couldn't be overcome in any way that there is no way to do that.  <br>
That was her way of talking... and thinking... and living as well... and perceiving the world of things and thoughts and all you can call at any time popping and popping and cooling; everything went on and on and soon that all will be one big bag of lies and the letters wouldn't ever be written on anything but the stone of human intellect and there is even more facts to come and there is even more facts to be opened at the same time. And this is no math and there is no certainty of things that could even be certain at some degree of understanding of the living matter of anything that you could call me or you or even some different name that doesn't belong to anyone on this planet of weird things of total weirdness of whatever that could ever be. <br> 
Or please don't even try to give me that crap that you are constantly trying to populate in my brain; in my world of thoughts and everything that surrounds me on that matter of viewing things and knowing things the way they are. God, I know and understand plenty, but how to feel it, how to give them a little life, how see them the way they really are, not the way someone wants you to see them. That someone will soon be hurt by knifes of destiny. God, I feel pity for them and they going to evolve from absolute nothing to the absolute everything and that everything is not just everything and nothing at the same time this is the dirt that was called experience of being experienced indeed.  <br>
And one more time I want ping to be pong and it is too sad to fully comprehend that ping will never be pong because there is no ping and there is no pong in this dark place of sadness. Sadness and sadness one more time. Sadness of being sad and sadness of not even being here. Contradictions are always torture and all you could do is just think and think and type so you would never stop doing this useless thing. <br>
