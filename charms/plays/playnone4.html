So, is that some kind of strange coincidence? Whether or not I am not going to do it anyway. It is kind of funky and strange because it is me who doesn't want to do anything in this world but be uncertain if you can call it "be" anyway - so be proud of what you doing and relax as fast as possible because it is not healthy and sporty too. God damn what bullshit...<br>
I was doomed and saturated with all that crap that I couldn't overcome myself and it is getting even nastier than it really is and it is not doing what it's supposed to do. Well, anyway, I will see what I can do and think what I can't do.  <br>
And the main thing is that it's never funny and witty and cool - it is always interesting, but no more. <br>
But what?<br>
