        <p align="justify"><FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica,arial" SIZE=2>America you are great. <br>
You have everything.  <br>
Besides all the thing that you have  <br>
You have a resistance that portraits to obedience.  <br>
                           <p>
You really have nothing to be against,<br>
Everyone is free  <br>
Everyone is free not to be against, <br>
Because why would you be even against something <br>
When you are free not to have this something.   <br>
                <p>
You have admirers.    <br>
They are great    <br>
They are patriots. <br>
And they are free to trade.    <br>
                        <p>
You have protesters.    <br>
And they are free too.   <br>
They are free not to protest by protesting.  <br>
                     <p>
You have gangsters.   <br>
They are bad and against. <br>
They are free to hate.    <br>
For example they hate gay people. <br>
                             <p>
When this gangster is about to enter the scene where multiple fans are awaiting poetry or aggression, he knows that his hit will not be on a top for a long time.  <br>
Why?   <br>
Because he is free not to hate. <br>
Moreover he doesn't hate. <br>
He displays hatred but he doesn't REALLY hate. <br>
He doesn't really hate that gay stylist when getting his hair done before entering the scene where he will assure his clients to "piss on that sissy".   <br>
He would even suck his gay stylist butt if that would be the price for delivering such an invaluable gift of self-display. He needs to deliver. (On another hand he is free to work in Pizza place: he could hate gays and he would not even have to deal with dealing with them.)<br>
He is free not to rap and be humorous about his sucking his stylist's butt.  <br>
He is free to suck his stylist's butt. <br>
He is free to like it. He is free not to like it. <br>
                         <p>
America you bought this contradiction. No one really thinks about it anymore. Everyone is free not to. Everyone is free to be free. Pursuit of happiness and hatred and freedom and hope and desperation.  <br> 
   <p>
Pursuit of the freedom not to pursue.  <br>
